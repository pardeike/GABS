# GABS Repository - AI Agent Instructions

## Purpose

You are working on the **GABS (Game Agent Bridge Server)** repository. GABS is a MCP server implementing GABP, a communication protocol that enables AI tools to interact with games through a standardized interface, similar to how Language Server Protocol (LSP) enables code editors to work with language servers.

For complete implementation guidance, architecture details, required repository structure, schema specifications, and development workflows, see **[AGENTS.md](../docs/AGENTS.md)**.
