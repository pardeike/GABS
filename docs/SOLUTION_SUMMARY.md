# Solution Summary: GABS Application Lifecycle Management

## Problem Analysis

The issue requested fixes for critical application lifecycle management problems in GABS that prevented proper game control, especially when using Steam App IDs.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Steam App ID resolution failure**: Starting/stopping games using Steam App ID (e.g., "294100") instead of game ID (e.g., "rimworld") would fail with "not found" errors
2. **Incomplete process state tracking**: Applications weren't properly tracked in global state, leading to inconsistent status reporting  
3. **Missing GABP integration**: Bridge configuration wasn't automatically created when starting games, breaking the connection between GABS and game mods
4. **Poor process lifecycle handling**: Dead processes weren't cleaned up, and Steam/Epic launcher processes weren't distinguished from actual game processes

## Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Process Status Detection

**Added robust `IsRunning()` method** (`internal/process/controller.go`):
- Cross-platform process state checking using signal 0  
- **Enhanced Steam/Epic process tracking**: When `stopProcessName` is configured, GABS can now accurately track actual game processes by name
- Automatic cleanup of dead processes from the global games map
- Distinguished between Steam/Epic launcher processes and actual game processes with clear status reporting
- **Eliminated "cannot track" messages** when sufficient tracking information is available

```go
func (c *Controller) IsRunning() bool {
    // Enhanced Steam/Epic tracking when stopProcessName is available
    if c.spec.Mode == "SteamAppId" || c.spec.Mode == "EpicAppId" {
        if c.spec.StopProcessName != "" {
            // Can now track actual game process by name
            pids, err := findProcessesByName(c.spec.StopProcessName)
            return err == nil && len(pids) > 0
        }
        return false // Without stopProcessName, cannot track
    }
    
    // For direct processes, check if still alive
    err := c.cmd.Process.Signal(syscall.Signal(0))
    return err == nil
}
```

### 2. Integrated GABP Bridge Configuration  

**Auto-creation of bridge config** (`internal/mcp/stdio_server.go`):
- Bridge configuration automatically created when starting any game via `games.start` MCP tool
- Includes proper port allocation, secure token generation, and host/mode settings from game config
- Enhanced logging shows GABP connection details (port, masked token, config path)

```go
// Create GABP bridge configuration before starting process
port, token, bridgePath, err := config.WriteBridgeJSONWithConfig(game.ID, "", bridgeConfig)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to create bridge config: %w", err)
}
```

### 3. Fixed Steam App ID Resolution

**Enhanced `resolveGameId()` method**:
- Properly handles both game ID and target resolution
- Steam App ID ("294100") resolves to same game as game ID ("rimworld")  
- Process cleanup logic no longer interferes with resolution

Both of these work identically:
```json
{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "games.start", "arguments": {"gameId": "rimworld"}}}
{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "games.start", "arguments": {"gameId": "294100"}}}
```

### 4. Improved Application State Management

**Process controllers properly managed**:
- Controllers stored in `server.games` map keyed by game ID
- Multiple access methods (game ID vs Steam App ID) operate on same underlying state  
- Enhanced status reporting with PID tracking and better error messages
- Proper cleanup on process termination

### 5. Improved Process Tracking Capabilities

**Enhanced tracking for Steam/Epic games** (`internal/mcp/stdio_server.go`):
- Games with `stopProcessName` configured can now be accurately tracked by monitoring the actual game process
- Status reporting intelligently shows "cannot track" only when truly no tracking information is available  
- Clear user guidance provided for configuring tracking capabilities
- Better distinction between launcher processes and actual game processes

**Example Status Outputs**:
- **With tracking**: "running (GABS is tracking the game process)"
- **Without tracking**: "launched via SteamAppId (GABS cannot track the game process - no stopProcessName configured)"
- **Direct games**: "running (GABS controls the process)" (always trackable)

## Configuration-First Architecture

The actual GABS implementation uses a **configuration-first approach** that is more elegant than CLI-heavy game management:

### Current Workflow:
1. **Configure games once**: `gabs games add minecraft` (interactive setup)
2. **Start MCP server**: `gabs server` 
3. **AI controls games**: Using MCP tools like `games.start {"gameId": "minecraft"}`

### MCP Tools Available:
- `games.list` - List configured games and their status
- `games.start` - Start a game (auto-creates GABP bridge)
- `games.stop` - Stop a game gracefully  
- `games.kill` - Force terminate a game
- `games.status` - Check detailed game status
- `games.tools` - List GABP tools from connected game mods

### Key Advantages:
- **Separation of concerns**: Configuration (CLI) vs Control (MCP)
- **AI-friendly**: Natural tool-based game control
- **Flexible ID resolution**: Use game ID or Steam App ID interchangeably
- **Automatic bridge setup**: GABP configuration created seamlessly

## Validation

End-to-end MCP testing confirmed all issues resolved:
- ✅ Steam App ID "294100" correctly resolves to configured game  
- ✅ Starting with Steam App ID creates GABP bridge and launches game
- ✅ Status tracking shows proper state transitions (stopped → running/launched)
- ✅ **Enhanced process tracking**: Games with `stopProcessName` configured show accurate running/stopped status instead of "cannot track" messages
- ✅ Bridge configuration contains all necessary GABP connection information
- ✅ Process cleanup prevents stale entries in games map
- ✅ Multiple start attempts handle gracefully (no "not found" errors)
- ✅ **Improved user experience**: Clear distinction between trackable and non-trackable games with helpful configuration guidance
- ✅ All existing functionality remains backward compatible

## Changes Made

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/mcp/stdio_server.go`: Enhanced game lifecycle management and GABP integration
- `internal/process/controller.go`: Added robust process state detection and launcher handling  
- `internal/mcp/lifecycle_test.go`: Comprehensive test suite validating all improvements

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Automatic GABP bridge creation** when starting games
2. **Enhanced process state tracking** with accurate Steam/Epic game process monitoring when `stopProcessName` is configured
3. **Steam App ID resolution** works seamlessly alongside game IDs  
4. **Intelligent status reporting** that only shows "cannot track" when truly no tracking information is available
5. **Process cleanup** prevents stale state accumulation
6. **Improved user experience** with clear guidance on configuration requirements for full tracking capabilities

The fixes are minimal and surgical, preserving backward compatibility while resolving the core application lifecycle issues that were blocking effective AI-game integration.
