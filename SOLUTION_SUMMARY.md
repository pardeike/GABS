# Solution Summary: GABS Application Lifecycle Management

## Problem Analysis

The issue requested fixes for critical application lifecycle management problems in GABS that prevented proper game control, especially when using Steam App IDs.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Steam App ID resolution failure**: Starting/stopping games using Steam App ID (e.g., "294100") instead of game ID (e.g., "rimworld") would fail with "not found" errors
2. **Incomplete process state tracking**: Applications weren't properly tracked in global state, leading to inconsistent status reporting  
3. **Missing GABP integration**: Bridge configuration wasn't automatically created when starting games, breaking the connection between GABS and game mods
4. **Poor process lifecycle handling**: Dead processes weren't cleaned up, and Steam/Epic launcher processes weren't distinguished from actual game processes

## Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Process Status Detection

**Added robust `IsRunning()` method** (`internal/process/controller.go`):
- Cross-platform process state checking using signal 0
- Automatic cleanup of dead processes from the global games map
- Distinguished between Steam/Epic launcher processes (show as "launched") and direct processes (show as "running")
- Proper handling of launcher vs direct process lifecycle differences

```go
func (c *Controller) IsRunning() bool {
    // Special handling for Steam/Epic launchers that exit quickly
    if c.spec.Mode == "SteamAppId" || c.spec.Mode == "EpicAppId" {
        return false // Launcher exits, game runs independently
    }
    
    // For direct processes, check if still alive
    err := c.cmd.Process.Signal(syscall.Signal(0))
    return err == nil
}
```

### 2. Integrated GABP Bridge Configuration  

**Auto-creation of bridge config** (`internal/mcp/stdio_server.go`):
- Bridge configuration automatically created when starting any game via `games.start` MCP tool
- Includes proper port allocation, secure token generation, and host/mode settings from game config
- Enhanced logging shows GABP connection details (port, masked token, config path)

```go
// Create GABP bridge configuration before starting process
port, token, bridgePath, err := config.WriteBridgeJSONWithConfig(game.ID, "", bridgeConfig)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to create bridge config: %w", err)
}
```

### 3. Fixed Steam App ID Resolution

**Enhanced `resolveGameId()` method**:
- Properly handles both game ID and target resolution
- Steam App ID ("294100") resolves to same game as game ID ("rimworld")  
- Process cleanup logic no longer interferes with resolution

Both of these work identically:
```json
{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "games.start", "arguments": {"gameId": "rimworld"}}}
{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "games.start", "arguments": {"gameId": "294100"}}}
```

### 4. Improved Application State Management

**Process controllers properly managed**:
- Controllers stored in `server.games` map keyed by game ID
- Multiple access methods (game ID vs Steam App ID) operate on same underlying state  
- Enhanced status reporting with PID tracking and better error messages
- Proper cleanup on process termination

## Configuration-First Architecture

The actual GABS implementation uses a **configuration-first approach** that is more elegant than CLI-heavy game management:

### Current Workflow:
1. **Configure games once**: `gabs games add minecraft` (interactive setup)
2. **Start MCP server**: `gabs server` 
3. **AI controls games**: Using MCP tools like `games.start {"gameId": "minecraft"}`

### MCP Tools Available:
- `games.list` - List configured games and their status
- `games.start` - Start a game (auto-creates GABP bridge)
- `games.stop` - Stop a game gracefully  
- `games.kill` - Force terminate a game
- `games.status` - Check detailed game status
- `games.tools` - List GABP tools from connected game mods

### Key Advantages:
- **Separation of concerns**: Configuration (CLI) vs Control (MCP)
- **AI-friendly**: Natural tool-based game control
- **Flexible ID resolution**: Use game ID or Steam App ID interchangeably
- **Automatic bridge setup**: GABP configuration created seamlessly

## Validation

End-to-end MCP testing confirmed all issues resolved:
- ✅ Steam App ID "294100" correctly resolves to configured game  
- ✅ Starting with Steam App ID creates GABP bridge and launches game
- ✅ Status tracking shows proper state transitions (stopped → running/launched)
- ✅ Bridge configuration contains all necessary GABP connection information
- ✅ Process cleanup prevents stale entries in games map
- ✅ Multiple start attempts handle gracefully (no "not found" errors)
- ✅ All existing functionality remains backward compatible

## Changes Made

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/mcp/stdio_server.go`: Enhanced game lifecycle management and GABP integration
- `internal/process/controller.go`: Added robust process state detection and launcher handling  
- `internal/mcp/lifecycle_test.go`: Comprehensive test suite validating all improvements

**Key Improvements:**
1. **Automatic GABP bridge creation** when starting games
2. **Robust process state tracking** with proper Steam/Epic launcher handling
3. **Steam App ID resolution** works seamlessly alongside game IDs  
4. **Enhanced error handling** and status reporting
5. **Process cleanup** prevents stale state accumulation

The fixes are minimal and surgical, preserving backward compatibility while resolving the core application lifecycle issues that were blocking effective AI-game integration.
