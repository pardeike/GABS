# 🎮 GABS - Game Agent Bridge Server

**Make your game mods AI-ready in minutes!**

GABS is a universal bridge that connects AI tools to your game modifications. Whether you're modding Minecraft, RimWorld, or any other game, GABS lets AI assistants understand and interact with your mods automatically.

## 🚀 Why GABS?

**For Game Modders:**
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Development**: Let AI assistants help debug, test, and develop your mods
- 🔧 **Universal Tool**: Works with any game, any mod framework, any AI assistant
- 🌐 **Cross-Platform**: One binary runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ⚡ **Zero Setup**: Drop in the binary and you're ready to go
- 🔒 **Secure**: Local-only connections with token authentication

**Real Examples:**
- Ask AI to test your new crafting recipe while you code
- Have AI automatically detect bugs in your building system
- Let AI assistants read your mod's documentation and help users
- Debug multiplayer sync issues with AI monitoring game state

## 🛠️ What is GABS?

GABS implements the [GABP (Game Agent Bridge Protocol)](https://github.com/pardeike/GABP) - a standard way for AI tools to communicate with games. Think of it as a translator that lets AI assistants "speak" to your game mods.

```
Your AI Assistant ← → GABS ← → Your Game Mod ← → Your Game
```

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **Works with any game**: Not tied to specific games or engines  
- 🧠 **Works with any AI**: Compatible with ChatGPT, Claude, local LLMs, and custom AI tools
- 🔌 **Easy integration**: Simple JSON API that any mod can implement
- 📡 **Real-time events**: AI gets live updates as things happen in your game
- 📚 **Resource access**: AI can read game files, configs, and documentation
- 🛠️ **Tool execution**: AI can trigger actions in your game

## 📦 Quick Start

### 1. Download GABS

Choose your platform:
- **Windows**: [`gabs-windows-amd64.exe`](../../releases/latest)
- **macOS**: [`gabs-darwin-arm64`](../../releases/latest) 
- **Linux**: [`gabs-linux-amd64`](../../releases/latest)

### 2. Basic Usage

```bash
# Launch your game with GABS bridge
gabs run --gameId minecraft --launch DirectPath --target "/path/to/minecraft"

# Or connect to already running game
gabs attach --gameId minecraft

# Check if everything is working  
gabs status --gameId minecraft
```

### 3. Integration with AI Tools

GABS acts as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, so it works automatically with:
- **Claude Desktop** (with MCP support)
- **VS Code** (with MCP extensions)
- **Custom AI tools** (using MCP protocol)

## 🎯 Supported Launch Modes

GABS can start your game in multiple ways:

```bash
# Direct executable path
gabs run --gameId mygame --launch DirectPath --target "/path/to/game.exe"

# Steam games (by App ID)
gabs run --gameId rimworld --launch SteamAppId --target 294100

# Epic Games
gabs run --gameId mygame --launch EpicAppId --target "GameIdentifier"

# Custom command with arguments
gabs run --gameId mygame --launch CustomCommand --target "launcher.exe" --arg "--windowed" --arg "--debug"
```

## 🔧 Configuration

GABS automatically creates configuration files in platform-specific locations:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/GAB/your-game-id/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/GAB/your-game-id/`  
- **Linux**: `~/.local/state/gab/your-game-id/`

The `bridge.json` file contains connection details that your mod reads to connect to GABS.

## 🏗️ For Mod Developers

### Adding GABP Support to Your Mod

1. **Read the bridge config** when your mod starts:
   ```json
   {
     "port": 12345,
     "token": "secret-auth-token",
     "launchId": "unique-session-id"
   }
   ```

2. **Connect to GABS** using the GABP protocol (see [GABP Specification](https://github.com/pardeike/GABP))

3. **Expose your functionality** as tools, resources, and events

### Example Integration

```csharp
// C# example for Unity/Harmony mods
public class GABPMod : Mod {
    void Start() {
        var config = ReadBridgeConfig();  // Read port/token from bridge.json
        var client = new GABPClient(config.port, config.token);
        
        // Register your mod's capabilities
        client.RegisterTool("inventory/get", GetInventory);
        client.RegisterTool("world/place_block", PlaceBlock);
        client.RegisterEvent("player/move");
        
        client.Connect();
    }
}
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### HTTP Mode (for web-based AI tools)

```bash
# Run as HTTP server instead of stdio
gabs run --gameId mygame --target "/path/to/game" --http "localhost:8080"
```

### Multiple Games

```bash
# Run different games simultaneously  
gabs run --gameId minecraft --target "/path/to/minecraft" --http ":8080"
gabs run --gameId rimworld --target "/path/to/rimworld" --http ":8081"  
```

### Process Management

```bash
# Start game but don't run MCP server yet
gabs start --gameId mygame --target "/path/to/game"

# Later, connect MCP to running game
gabs attach --gameId mygame

# Stop gracefully
gabs stop --gameId mygame

# Force kill if needed
gabs kill --gameId mygame

# Restart game
gabs restart --gameId mygame
```

## 🔧 Build from Source

Requirements: Go 1.22+

```bash
# Build for your platform
go build ./cmd/gabs

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Or manually:
GOOS=darwin  GOARCH=arm64  go build -o dist/gabs-darwin-arm64 ./cmd/gabs
GOOS=linux   GOARCH=amd64  go build -o dist/gabs-linux-amd64  ./cmd/gabs

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to modify my existing mod to use GABS?**  
A: Yes, your mod needs to implement the GABP protocol to communicate with GABS. But it's just a simple JSON API!

**Q: Can multiple AI tools connect at the same time?**  
A: Currently, one AI tool per game instance. Run multiple GABS instances for multiple AI connections.

**Q: Does this work with multiplayer games?**  
A: GABS connects to your local mod instance. Multiplayer compatibility depends on your mod's design.

**Q: Is this secure?**  
A: GABS only accepts local connections and uses token authentication. Your game never exposes ports to the internet.

**Q: What games are supported?**  
A: Any game where you can add mods that implement GABP! We have examples for Unity, C#/Harmony, and Java games.
